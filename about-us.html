    To supplement the theoretical and practical aspects of the properties of longest common subsequences, we have developed a suite of interactive tools to help visualize and understand the various properties and algorithms associated with the LCS problem. The Binary Longest InterString Subsequence (BLISS) Playground is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to interact with the underlying algorithms and data structures in real-time. The tools are web-based, making them accessible to a wide audience.
